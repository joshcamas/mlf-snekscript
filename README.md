### About SnekScript

SnekScript is a runtime python engine utilizing [IronPython](https://ironpython.net/). Alongside the MLF Interpretor, it adds a variety of features for writing scripts in Unity - for example, management of scopes, and splitting up scripts into management bite-sized pieces without having to have dozens of separate files. Currently there is essentially 0 documentation, since this is simply used in-house for [Ardenfall](https://twitter.com/ardenfall?lang=en) at the moment.
